Just after complete my graduation, I have the opportunity to serve my alma mater and presently I am working as a Lecturer in the [Department of CSE](http://aust.edu/cse/index.htm) at my place of graduation.  My primary research interest lies at Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Data Mining and Medical Image Processing.
